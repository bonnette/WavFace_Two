# WavFace_Two
Updated Adafruit wavface Project.
This project uses 5 LED matrix's to create a face. It was created by Phillip Burgess for Adafruit. 
The project here in this repository uses his code, but the hardware is modified to use a Trinket Pro and an mini FX
board for the voice. The PDF file contains information and pictures of the project as well as the schematic diagram.
The code is the original code from Phillip Burgess but with my changes to add the FX card and a motion sensor.
